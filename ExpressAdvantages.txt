Express is a connect based web framework (middleware for NodeJS). One of the biggest adavantages of Express
is that it removes a lot of overhead code that you had to write with nodejs and connect middleware. For example
you can just write res.send() instead of of res.setHeaders and res.end. Express automatically puts in the content-type 
depending on the type of data you passed it. 

Express also has a host of useful functions and a very robust routing api. It makes routing in Nodejs applications much simpler and adds a lot of
routing features absent in Nodejs.

I am still reading the express chapter, I will update this text file after I complete the chapter.
